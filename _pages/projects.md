## Open Source Tools

I develop open source tools for climate science and coastal monitoring. Current projects focus on:

- **LiDAR Coastal Monitoring**: Workflows for processing and analyzing coastal elevation data
- **Marine Carbon Removal Analysis**: Tools for assessing OAE scalability and environmental impacts
- **Climate Policy Data**: Frameworks for governance and regulatory analysis

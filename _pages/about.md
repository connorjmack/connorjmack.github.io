I am a PhD student at **Scripps Institution of Oceanography** at UC San Diego, studying climate change mitigation and marine carbon dioxide removal. My research sits at the intersection of environmental science and policy, focusing on how we can responsibly scale ocean-based climate solutions.

## Research Interests

My work centers on three interconnected areas:

- **Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE)**: Assessing the scalability and carbon removal potential of this promising marine CDR approach
- **Climate Governance**: Analyzing policy frameworks for responsible deployment of marine carbon removal technologies  
- **Coastal Monitoring**: Developing LiDAR-based methods for tracking coastal change and environmental dynamics

## Current Projects

I'm currently leading research on the global scalability of ocean alkalinity enhancement, with a paper under review at *Nature Communications*. This work examines realistic deployment scenarios and identifies key policy interventions needed to support responsible industry growth.

I'm also exploring how governance structures—like public benefit corporation requirements—can help align private marine carbon removal efforts with public interest and ocean stewardship.

I am a PhD candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, building open source tools for problem-solving at the intersection of climate science and policy, with a focus on responsible scaling of climate technologies.

My research combines oceanography, data science, and policy analysis to address critical questions about marine carbon dioxide removal (MCDR). I develop computational workflows for coastal monitoring using LiDAR technology and analyze the scalability and governance frameworks needed for responsible deployment of ocean-based climate solutions.

I'm particularly interested in ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) and how we can scale these technologies while ensuring environmental stewardship and building social license through transparent, science-driven approaches.

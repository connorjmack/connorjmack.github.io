Carbon dioxide emissions, the main cause of climate instability, are still rising worldwide. Cutting them is essential to stopping warming, but that by itself won't be enough. Large-scale carbon removal will be needed to stop and reverse climate change.

This opinion piece argues that the Biden administration's upcoming marine carbon removal policy recommendations should include a requirement that private firms be designated as public benefit corporations. This would ensure companies make decisions that benefit the ocean and communities, rather than focusing solely on profit.

**Key Points:**
- Marine carbon removal has potential for massive scale but carries environmental risks
- Pure economic incentives could misalign with responsible ocean stewardship
- Public benefit corporation requirement would help build trust and social license
- Responsible governance essential for science-driven industry development

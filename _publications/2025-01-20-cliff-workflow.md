Coastal monitoring is essential for understanding erosion and preparing for climate impacts. This paper presents an automated workflow for processing large-scale LiDAR datasets to detect and quantify coastal cliff changes over time, making it easier for researchers and coastal managers to track erosion patterns efficiently.
